# DS-6040-Project

Your 1-page project proposal can contain any of your thoughts for your project. There is no prescribed structure for the document. Here are some suggestions and ideas for you as you get started. I hesitate to assign point/percentage weights to each of these three categories. Different "types" of projects will emphasize different areas.

1. *Data:* are your data "interesting?"
For example:
- is your data set large (e.g. rows and/or columns, total filesize, etc.)
- is your data set rare, expensive, or in some sense hard to come by?
- is your data set interesting for some other reason (needs a special data type in Python, etc.)

2. *Motivation:* why will people care about your work?
You might address the following points:
- is your goal primarily parameter inference or prediction/forecasting?
- are you interested in making causal conclusions?
- why will your insights matter? (socially, economically, etc.)
- which aspects of your project are theoretical? which are more applied?
- are you genuinely interested in this topic? will your enthusiasm be evident?

3. *Foresight:* how will this project turn out, and what will be the primary challenges be?
You don't need to be able to answer all of these, but you should definitely start thinking about them:
- Will you be able to get close to "state of the art"
- What will your project's primary shortcoming be? Will it be excusable?
- What is/are the "bottleneck(s)" of your project (e.g. theory, computations, data size, etc.) How will you resolve these issues?
- Do your group members have complementary skill sets?
- Will you require some special resource (computer cluster access, database access, etc.)
