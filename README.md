# DS-6040-Project

Your 1-page project proposal can contain any of your thoughts for your project. There is no prescribed structure for the document. Here are some suggestions and ideas for you as you get started. I hesitate to assign point/percentage weights to each of these three categories. Different "types" of projects will emphasize different areas.

We would like to apply Bayesian Machine Learning in health-related data for this project, specifically health questions available through public sources or government open-data portals. We have considered several benefits for using public facing data for the project, such as ease of data acquisition, promotion of data transparency between organizations and citizens, along with prospect of reproducible research, to name a few. However, a few disadvantages that we're leveraging are the lack of standardization between datasets (agency dependent), missing data without context, lack of descriptions on major events that could impact data or data quality, etc. Some data wrangling is necessary to remedy some of the disadvantages of these data, but if there is too much missing data in a specific feature we're interested in, we might reconsider another feature or switch to another dataset entirely.     

1. *Data:* are your data "interesting?"
For example:
- is your data set large (e.g. rows and/or columns, total filesize, etc.)
- is your data set rare, expensive, or in some sense hard to come by?
- is your data set interesting for some other reason (needs a special data type in Python, etc.)

There is an urgent need for new technology or new approaches to modernize healthcare data. With the advances of electronic health records (EHR) and colossal governmenal databases 

2. *Motivation:* why will people care about your work?
You might address the following points:
- is your goal primarily parameter inference or prediction/forecasting?
- are you interested in making causal conclusions?
- why will your insights matter? (socially, economically, etc.)
- which aspects of your project are theoretical? which are more applied?
- are you genuinely interested in this topic? will your enthusiasm be evident?

We don't foresee needing to use any extensive computational resources for this project, however, if time permits, we could experiment with working on the cloud using AWS or Azure to simulate working with prediction data in a productionized environment. Some bottleneck that this project might encounter could be data size or the right data set or answer a specific question. 

3. *Foresight:* how will this project turn out, and what will be the primary challenges be?
You don't need to be able to answer all of these, but you should definitely start thinking about them:
- Will you be able to get close to "state of the art"
- What will your project's primary shortcoming be? Will it be excusable?
- What is/are the "bottleneck(s)" of your project (e.g. theory, computations, data size, etc.) How will you resolve these issues?
- Do your group members have complementary skill sets?
- Will you require some special resource (computer cluster access, database access, etc.)
